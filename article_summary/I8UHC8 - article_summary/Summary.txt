Different approaches were compared by the authors in order to predict the electrical power consumption every 10 minutes and decide which approach is the most successful.The used data set is related to three different power distributions in Tetouan city, and it was collected every 10 minutes for the period between 2017-01-01 and 2017-12-31.The feedforward neural network algorithm, random forest, decision tree, support vector machine for regression (SVR), and other algorithms were compared during the experiments, and eventually the results showed that Random forest performed better.
