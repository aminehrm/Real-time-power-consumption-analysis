consumption of a smart home and will forecast the future power c
onsumption using ARIMA model which gives better results for the time-series data analysis. This system aims is to predict the future electricity consumption for some services 
in smart homes in an efficient way. 

Predictive analysis is an approach to forecast data on the basis of historical data. 
Time-series data is the order of historical data, which resembles the group or 
observation of the data that have been collected over time according to the continuous 
period of time. It consists of four components: trend, seasonal effect, cyclical, and 
irregular effect [2]. The analysis of a time series used forecasting techniques is to 
identify and built models from the past data. According to the trend of data, we can 
forecast the future events.

Many models are implemented to deal with time series data, ARIMA is one of the models which 
can be used for predictive analysis. ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Moving Average; is 
actually a class of models that explains a given time-series data based on its own past 
values

ARIMA model uses the dependency between an observation and residual errors from a moving 
average model applied to lagged observations and are applied in cases where data shows some 
non-stationarity in it

The parameters of the ARIMA model are defined as follows: 
• p: Lag order; The number of lag observations included in the model. 
• d: Degree of differencing; The number of times that the raw observations are differenced. 
• q: moving average; The size of the moving average window.
